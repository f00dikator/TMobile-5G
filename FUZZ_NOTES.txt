GET requests URI
  - Within the URI, it seems like anything < 0x20 is filtered. And for >= 0x7f it is only certain. Everything else is allowed through.
    list of integer values which cause a 400 error [1..32, 127, 192, 193, 245..255]
  - e.g. GET /whatever.cgi?lan\x81\x98 is just read as GET /whatever.cgi?lan
  - same goes if we encode to %<INT>. e.g. GET /whatever.cgi?lan%129<ETC> is read just as GET /whatever.cgi?lan
